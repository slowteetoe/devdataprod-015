# devdataprod-015 : Coursera course project for Developing Data Products

## Summary
This project trained a randomforest to predict whether an individual would earn less than or more than 50,000 USD per year based on 11 predictors including age, education, race and gender.  All 11 predictors are exposed in the Shiny app to allow for users to try out various combinations.  Note: capital gain/loss is presented as a slider but translated into two variables in the model.

## Data
Data for this project was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). It consisted of a little over 30,000 observations.
